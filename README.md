# SDV-Assignment

### Setup and running of project
- Fork the repository and clone it.
- The project used `pipenv` to manage dependencies.
- Install [Pipenv](https://pypi.org/project/pipenv/) using the following command: 
``` bash
pip install pipenv
```
- Navigate to the project directory and initialize the environment using the following command - 
``` bash
pipenv shell
```
- The above step also activates the environment, for activating the environment in subsequent sessions type the following command:
```bash
pipenv shell
```
- At the root of your project directory <br>

```bash
pipenv install
```
- This will setup the project requirements and pre-commit test hooks!

After the above setup, run

``` python
python sdv.py
```
